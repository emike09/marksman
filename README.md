## Marksman - A Windows agent for Snipe-IT

## Installation
1. Download and install the latest .msi installer from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Scope-IT/marksman/releases/).
2. By default, the program will be installed in Program Files (x86)/Scope-IT/Marksman. Edit the Marksman.exe.config file to include your API key and BaseURI from the default values to the ones given by your Snipe-IT instance.
3. Set the Company and Location parameters in Marksman.exe.config, then run the .exe.

## Fork Changes
-Asset tags are now read from the Dell BIOS asset tag. 
-Asset tag prefixes and the - character are removed. 

## Features
* The agent creates an asset and fills out the fields:
  - Asset name (currently machine hostname, unless agent is run in interactive mode)
  - Asset id (Based on the Dell BIOS asset tag)
  - Location (from a config file or the Organizational Unit)
  - Warranty (from config file)
  - Status label (from config file)
  - Mac address
  - Make, model of the machine (as reported to Windows)
* Ensures that the assets created is unique
* New locations, makes, models are created as needed


## Getting started
You will need a working [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/) database with API access and an API key. 
*We recommend creating a separate user for the agent with minimal (read + add) permissions.*

You can run it via a GPO or Scheduled task (recommended way is to run the agent once on boot with a delay of 1+ minute)
